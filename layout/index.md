# Layout

There are numerous ways to handle layout.

The most basic thing to learn is the [Box Model](./boxes-boxes-boxes.md). After that, many layouts can be achieved with [Flexbox](./arranging-with-flexbox.md). Using just those two techniques we build our sample [Business Card](./nesting-flex-boxes.md) to show off the power of nesting flex boxes.

More complex designs can be built with [CSS Grid](./grid.md).

And finally, as a measure of last resort, we can use [absolute, relative or fixed positioning](./positioning.md) to tweak items.
