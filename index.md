# Web Design
Hello students -- repl.it is leaving us so I'm jumping ship and moving to GitHub, which should make it easier for me
to write and improve instructions over time.

This is the first step!

This webpage will grow and eventually replace the [Google Doc of How-To's](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MrPTAd-LPJpUH93BYElgGv_abhhagAWaURrOtqjfj9A/edit) that I made and shared with you earlier this semester.
