# JavaScript How-To's!
Hello students! I put together a new home for my how-to's hosted on github pages. My intention here is that these markdown files will be a bit longer lasting than the platforms we use to host code, which change from year to year (Cloud 9, repl.it, trinket.io, etc -- we've moved through a bunch over the past several years).

This webpage will grow and eventually replace the [Google Doc of How-To's](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MrPTAd-LPJpUH93BYElgGv_abhhagAWaURrOtqjfj9A/edit) that I made and shared with you earlier this semester.

#### Test
{%include local.html page="test.html" %}
