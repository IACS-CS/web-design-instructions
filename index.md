### Create a Canvas

Learn to [create a canvas](./canvas/creating_a_canvas.md)

### Hello

This is my first markdown file.
Really what I want to know is whether this thing works?

```html
<div>
  <h2>Test heading</h2>
  <p>This is a test of some HTML!</p>
</div>
```

```javascript
function () {
  console.log('hello world');
}
```

Here are some [instructions](./firstPage.md)

Testing youtube embed...
{% include youtube.html id="6qXpBqfmBrk" %}

Test codepen embed
{% include codepen.html id="PoOvJGO" %}
