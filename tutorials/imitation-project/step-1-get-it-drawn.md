# Drawing the Layout

Step 1 to any design should be hand drawing what you want.

For this tutorial, we're going to use already-existing designs to simplify the process.

## Step 1: Have a basic layout

Here's an example layout that I'll try to achieve.

## Step 2: Break it into pieces

As with all problem-solving, it is best to break one big problem into many small problems which you can tackle one at a time. The layout here presents the following challenges:

1. I have to make a grid of four identical looking watch images on the right
2. The back drop consists of a grey / white divide splitting the page.
3. There is a watch which needs to be placed such that the band is precisely on the grey/white divide
4. There is text which is rotated
5. The bottom of the text aligns perfectly with the bottom of the image grid.

## Step 3: Pick a piece to solve and use the appropriate tools.

This layout will require a number of tools, including:

1. Tweaking margins and padding.
2. A grid layout
3. Rotating text
4. Sizing items proportionally.
