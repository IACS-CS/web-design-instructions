# Building a Game

We're going to get started building our first game.

For this game, we're going to assume a very simple type of movement: we'll have an item moving in one dimension (left-right or top-bottom) dodging (or catching?) items that move toward it. Think: a baseball glove catching balls, or a paper airplane dodging rain drops.

Overall, we'll be taking the following steps:

1. Setting up our project (background, files, etc)
2. [Creating our "player" object](player.md).
3. [Letting the user move the object](events.md)
4. [Creating the computer objects and making them move.](multipleObjects.md)
5. [Detecting a collision between our player and our objects.](collisions.md)


I'm going to assume you can get step 1 completed on your own. If you have trouble, take a look at the [screensaver project set up, which should be very similar](../screensaver/setup.md).

Once you have a basic project set up, we're going to [create our player](./player.md)!
