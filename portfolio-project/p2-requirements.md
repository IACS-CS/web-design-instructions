# Project Requirements

Create a unique "Portfolio" that reflects your personality and identity as a designer.

## Content Requirements
1. Include an "About Me" that gives us some information about yourself.
 
1. Include projects with work and descriptions:
Possible projects include the following (you can also highlight non-web-design
work if you like, though I'd like you to include at least *one* web design project
in your portfolio):
    1. Choose-Your-Own Adventure Project
    2. Zen Garden Project
    3. Imitation Project
    4. Portfolio Project

1. Include sample code showing your understanding of key concepts from the class:
    1. HTML
    2. CSS
    3. JavaScript

2. Include at least one JavaScript-powered element to make your portfolio interactive, such as...
    1. Tabs / Sidebar / Slideshow or other content selector
    2. Extra "bling" or fun when a user scrolls, clicks or interacts with your page.
    3. Sliders or slideshows

3. Honors Requirements
   1. "Wow" me with a bold, beautiful and original design.
   2. Include at least one delightful "easter egg" in your site (let me know what it is if it's well hidden so I can give you credit for it!).


## Coding & Design Requirements

1. Write clear, well-formatted code.
2. Create a portfolio with attention to colors, typography and layout
3. Make sure there are clear "affordances" to make it clear how to 
   interact with your webpage.


## Process Requirements

1. "Commit" your code to github to save it each day.
2. Keep track of your goals and progress in a TODO.md file
3. Use comments to explain what your code does and to give credit where you have drawn heavily on examples from the internet or on help from github copilot or another AI.
