# Getting Started

[Next: How-To's](./how-tos.md)

Before you jump in, I'd recommend looking at some [model portfolios](./models.md) for inspiration.

Your next step should be writing a TODO list in the file `TODO.md`. That list will contain your design objectives, document your progress, and help you track what you need to do each day.

## Elements
Elements you will want to spend time on include:

1. **Landing Page / Hero**: What should it look like when a user loads your page?
2. **Showcasing Projects**: How can you showcase your work? Screenshots? iFrames? Links?
3. **Including and Explaining Examples**: Can you include some example code or concepts?
4. **Color Choices**: What colors represent your design style and help set the right mood for your portfolio?
5. **Typography**: Choose fonts that are readable and reflect your personal style.
6. **User Interaction & JavaScript**: Think about how users will interact with your site and how you can make it engaging.

Here is a possible example TODO list you could begin with:

## Example TODO List
- [ ] Choose a color scheme.
- [ ] Design a layout for the landing page.
  - [ ] Select a hero image or graphic.
  - [ ] Create a compelling headline and tagline.
- [ ] Decide on the format for showcasing projects.
  - [ ] Collect or create screenshots for each project.
  - [ ] Write brief descriptions for each project.  
- [ ] Include code snippets or concepts to illustrate technical skills.
  - [ ] Select examples of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript I've used.
  - [ ] Add comments to the code to explain its purpose.
- [ ] Typography
  - [ ] Research and select a primary and secondary font.
  - [ ] Choose a line-height and width for text elements that look nice.
- [ ] Plan JavaScript interactions.
  - [ ] Implement a navigation menu for easy browsing.
  - [ ] Create interactive elements like buttons or hover effects.
- [ ] Regularly commit changes to GitHub.
  - [ ] Set daily goals for coding and design tasks.
  - [ ] Review progress at the end of each day and plan for the next.

Remember, this is just a starting point. Feel free to customize your TODO list based on your project's requirements and your personal goals.
